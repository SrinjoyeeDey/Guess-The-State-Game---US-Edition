# 🗺️ Guess The State Game 🇺🇸

A fun and interactive Python-based U.S. States guessing game built using the turtle module! 🐢💻

# 🎯 What is this game about?

"Guess The State" is a Python game where you try to name all the 50 U.S. states!
Each correct guess reveals the state on a blank U.S. map — how many can YOU guess?
It’s an exciting challenge to test your geography skills while coding your way through Python's turtle graphics!

Think of it like "Name all the States or Bust!" 🚗💨

# 🛠️ Tech Used

Python 3 🐍

Turtle Graphics 🐢

Pandas 📊

CSV Data Handling 🗃️


# ✨ Features

Blank U.S. map where correct guesses are placed on their real location!

Real-time feedback on correct guesses ✅

Exits the game gracefully when you're done or give up ❌

Generates a .csv file with all the states you missed for future practice 📄


# 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the game using Python.


2. A U.S. map appears with a prompt: "What's another state's name?"


3. Type the name of any U.S. state and press Enter.


4. If correct, the state's name appears on the map in its correct location!


5. Try to name all 50 before giving up — or see how many you can remember!
